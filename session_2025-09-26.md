# Session 2025-09-26

## Summary
- Defined GitHub repo structure (`context/`, `prompts/`, `outputs/`, `logs/`).
- Decided Lisa will load from `project_overview.md` + `lisa_boot.md` each session.
- Created initial prompt structure:
  - Active section (current tasks).  
  - Completed section (past tasks + file references).  
- Started seeding backlog from earlier conversations.  

## Decisions
- Repo is the “memory core” → all prompts, logs, context stored here.  
- Lisa is the dispatcher → updates prompts + logs only.  
- Homer, Cursor, Smithers each pull tasks from their prompt files.  
- Theo’s role = steering, not routing every task manually.  

## Next Steps
- Populate `project_overview.md` with Notion QCSv1 doc summary.  
- Write Lisa’s boot file (`lisa_boot.md`).  
- Generate first batch of Homer prompts to create repo skeleton.
