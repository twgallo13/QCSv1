# Session 2025-09-21

## Summary
- Focused on improving Lisa’s role as dispatcher.
- Explored problems with Lisa:  
  - Overloaded with strategy + tactics.  
  - Handoff to Homer/Cursor required too much Theo copy-pasting.  
  - Lost context when starting new chats.  

## Decisions
- Introduce a potential “Max” (manager AI) to feed Lisa structured prompts.  
- Instead of adding Max immediately, create a **Lisa playbook** to guide her in generating prompts consistently.  
- Define Lisa’s reset/boot sequence: role card + starter prompt + context loading.  

## Next Steps
- Build repo structure where Lisa writes prompts into separate files (`homer_prompts.md`, etc.).  
- Establish log system so Lisa can recap sessions into `/logs/`.  
- Keep prompt backlog small (2–5 tasks active per AI).
