# Session 2025-09-20

## Summary
- Discussed challenges of working with multiple AIs in one chat (messy, noisy, loss of context).
- Identified best practices:  
  - Separate chats by topic/role.  
  - Use summaries and checkpoints.  
  - Externalize important info into docs.  
  - Define roles for each AI.  
  - Tag or label prompts (#decision, #todo, #draft).  

## Decisions
- Theo will use multiple AIs as a team:
  - Lisa = prompt engineer / dispatcher.  
  - Homer = coder (GitHub Copilot).  
  - Cursor = designer/dev-helper (Cursor App AI).  
  - Smithers = documentation & analysis (Notion AI).  
  - Matt = meta-advisor (AI coach).  

## Next Steps
- Explore how Lisa can better handle handoffs to Homer and Cursor.
- Consider repo-based workflow for memory persistence.
